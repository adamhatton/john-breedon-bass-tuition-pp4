                <p>I have been playing bass for over 30 years, during which time I have toured the
                    world with different bands and have played on dozens of commercial releases. I started tutoring in
                    2006 in order to share my experience and help people get the same joy out of playing bass that I do
                </p>
                <p>In my time tutoring, I have worked with learners of all ages, from school age right through to 75
                    (it's never too late to learn!). I'm experienced in many different styles and techniques, so
                    whatever your goal is I will be able to help you reach it.</p>
